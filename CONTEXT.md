## Tech Stack
*Frontend:*
- Vanilla JavaScript (GitHub Pages)
- HTML/CSS for UI

*Backend:*
- Express.js (Node.js framework)
- Prisma (Database toolkit)
- Railway (Hosting)

*Database:*
- PostgreSQL (via Railway)

*Testing:*
- Playwright (End-to-end testing)
- http-server (Local frontend serving for tests)

## Frontend Structure
*Public Features:*
- Browse/search games directory (with pagination/lazy loading)
- View any game's guides (main game, DLCs, different completion types)
- See the full achievement tree structure for any guide
- Read guide content and tips
*Private Features (Login Required):*
- Check off achievements as completed (like a to-do app)
- See your progress through the tree
- Personal notes on achievements
- The tree shows your completion status, but doesn't "lock" anything

## Backend API Structure
*Public Endpoints:*
- `GET /api/games` - List all games (with search/pagination)
- `GET /api/games/:gameId/guides` - Get all guides for a game
- `GET /api/guides/:guideId` - Get full achievement tree for a guide
*Private Endpoints (Require Authentication):*
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/user/progress/:guideId` - Get user's progress for a guide
- `POST /api/user/progress/:guideId/achievement/:achievementId` - Mark achievement as complete
- `DELETE /api/user/progress/:guideId/achievement/:achievementId` - Unmark achievement

## Database Structure

### Core Tables:

*Games Table:*
- id, steamAppId (optional), name, description, releaseDate, imageUrl, published, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Has many:** Guides, Achievements
- **Note:** steamAppId is Steam's unique game identifier (e.g., 620 for Portal 2)

*Achievements Table:*
- id, gameId, name, description, steamAchievementId (optional), iconUrl (optional), createdAt, updatedAt
- **Belongs to:** Game
- **Note:** These are the game's full achievement list (pulled from Steam API)

*Guides Table:*
- id, gameId, title, description, published, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Belongs to:** Game
- **Uses many:** Achievements (through GuideAchievement junction table)

### Junction Table (Many-to-Many):

*GuideAchievement Table:*
- id, guideId, achievementId, orderInTree, parentGuideAchievementId (optional), notes (optional), createdAt, updatedAt
- **Purpose:** Connects Achievements to Guides with guide-specific tree structure
- **Note:** The tree structure (order, parent) is specific to each guide
- **parentGuideAchievementId:** References another GuideAchievement (not Achievement), creating the tree within the guide

### User Tables:

*Users Table:*
- id, email, passwordHash, username, createdAt, updatedAt

*UserProgress Table:*
- id, userId, achievementId, completedAt, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Purpose:** Tracks which achievements a user has completed (global to the game)
- **Note:** References Achievement directly - once completed, it shows as done in all guides for that game

### Relationship Flow:
```
Game
  â”œâ”€ has many Achievements (the game's full list from Steam)
  â””â”€ has many Guides (different completion paths)
  
Guide
  â””â”€ uses many Achievements through GuideAchievement
      â””â”€ each GuideAchievement defines order & parent for that guide's tree

User
  â””â”€ has many UserProgress entries
      â””â”€ each tracks completion of an Achievement (global, not guide-specific)
```

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹

**Frontend Development (Current Focus):**
1. **Display achievements on frontend**
   - Create game detail page
   - Show Year Walk achievements with icons
   - Achievement cards with descriptions
   - Link from homepage to game detail page

2. **Implement search functionality**
   - Filter games array as user types
   - Re-render grid with filtered results
   - Connect search input to filtering logic
   
3. **Error handling & empty states**
   - Show message if API is down
   - Show message if no games match search
   - Loading spinner while fetching (already implemented)
   - Handle network errors gracefully

**API Development:**
1. **Build more public endpoints**
   - GET /api/games/:gameId - Get single game with details
   - GET /api/games/:gameId/guides - Get all guides for a game
   - GET /api/guides/:guideId - Get guide with achievement tree

3. **Install authentication packages**
   - `npm install bcrypt jsonwebtoken`
   - bcrypt: Hash and verify passwords
   - jsonwebtoken: Create and verify JWTs

4. **Build authentication endpoints**
   - POST /api/auth/register (hash password, create user)
   - POST /api/auth/login (verify password, return JWT)
   - Create JWT middleware for protected routes

5. **Build protected endpoints**
   - GET /api/user/progress/:guideId - Get user's progress
   - POST /api/user/progress/achievement/:achievementId - Mark achievement complete
   - DELETE /api/user/progress/achievement/:achievementId - Unmark achievement
   - GET /api/user/profile - Get user info

6. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Connect GitHub repo to Railway
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy backend
   - Test production API

7. **Steam API Integration**
   - Research Steam Web API
   - Build endpoint to fetch game data from Steam
   - Build endpoint to fetch achievements from Steam
   - Auto-populate database with Steam data
