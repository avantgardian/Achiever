## Tech Stack
*Frontend:*
- Vanilla JavaScript (GitHub Pages)
- HTML/CSS for UI

*Backend:*
- Express.js (Node.js framework)
- Prisma (Database toolkit)
- Railway (Hosting)

*Database:*
- PostgreSQL (via Railway)

*Testing:*
- Playwright (End-to-end testing)
- http-server (Local frontend serving for tests)

## Frontend Structure
*Public Features:*
- Browse/search games directory (with pagination/lazy loading)
- View any game's guides (main game, DLCs, different completion types)
- See the full achievement tree structure for any guide
- Read guide content and tips
*Private Features (Login Required):*
- Check off achievements as completed (like a to-do app)
- See your progress through the tree
- Personal notes on achievements
- The tree shows your completion status, but doesn't "lock" anything

## Backend API Structure
*Public Endpoints:*
- `GET /api/games` - List all games (with search/pagination)
- `GET /api/games/:gameId/guides` - Get all guides for a game
- `GET /api/guides/:guideId` - Get full achievement tree for a guide
*Private Endpoints (Require Authentication):*
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/user/progress/:guideId` - Get user's progress for a guide
- `POST /api/user/progress/:guideId/achievement/:achievementId` - Mark achievement as complete
- `DELETE /api/user/progress/:guideId/achievement/:achievementId` - Unmark achievement

## Database Structure

### Core Tables:

*Games Table:*
- id, steamAppId (optional), name, description, releaseDate, imageUrl, published, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Has many:** Guides, Achievements
- **Note:** steamAppId is Steam's unique game identifier (e.g., 620 for Portal 2)

*Achievements Table:*
- id, gameId, name, description, steamAchievementId (optional), iconUrl (optional), createdAt, updatedAt
- **Belongs to:** Game
- **Note:** These are the game's full achievement list (pulled from Steam API)

*Guides Table:*
- id, gameId, title, description, published, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Belongs to:** Game
- **Uses many:** Achievements (through GuideAchievement junction table)

### Junction Table (Many-to-Many):

*GuideAchievement Table:*
- id, guideId, achievementId, orderInTree, parentGuideAchievementId (optional), notes (optional), createdAt, updatedAt
- **Purpose:** Connects Achievements to Guides with guide-specific tree structure
- **Note:** The tree structure (order, parent) is specific to each guide
- **parentGuideAchievementId:** References another GuideAchievement (not Achievement), creating the tree within the guide

### User Tables:

*Users Table:*
- id, email, passwordHash, username, createdAt, updatedAt

*UserProgress Table:*
- id, userId, achievementId, completedAt, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Purpose:** Tracks which achievements a user has completed (global to the game)
- **Note:** References Achievement directly - once completed, it shows as done in all guides for that game

### Relationship Flow:
```
Game
  â”œâ”€ has many Achievements (the game's full list from Steam)
  â””â”€ has many Guides (different completion paths)
  
Guide
  â””â”€ uses many Achievements through GuideAchievement
      â””â”€ each GuideAchievement defines order & parent for that guide's tree

User
  â””â”€ has many UserProgress entries
      â””â”€ each tracks completion of an Achievement (global, not guide-specific)
```
